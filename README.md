# work-day-scheduler-pedro-guerra

## Description

In this bootcamp challenge, a work day scheduler needed to be improved from the starter code that had been given. In the starter code given, it had a lot of information on the HTML & CSS files, but almost nothing on the javascript file. The main goal of this assignment was to create a javascript file that provides the current day when the website is accessed. Then the website should save the logged information from the user and the information should persist even after the user refreshes/leaves the page. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This challenged allowed me to improve my JavaScript coding skills, as I was given a starter code with almost nothing inside of the JavaScript file, and had to develop a working code to display the current day, and save the logged information from the user even after the user refreshes or leaves the page.
